Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take different forms, i.e., a single action that can be performed in different ways. So, polymorphism means many forms.

Polymorphism is of two types:

-   Static polymorphism
    
-   Dynamic polymorphism

Polymorphism that gets resolved during compile time is known as **static polymorphism** or **compile time polymorphism**. This polymorphism is achieved using overloading of the methods in the same class, called as **Method overloading**.

Method overloading allows the programmer to have multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but differing in their signature.

Signature can differ by

-   the number of parameters
    
-   the data type of parameters
    
-   the order of the parameters
    

Note: We cannot overload methods by their return type, i.e., two or more methods are not overloaded if they differ only in their return type.
