Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take different forms, i.e., a single action that can be performed in different ways. So, polymorphism means many forms.

Polymorphism is of two types:

-   Static polymorphism
    
-   Dynamic polymorphism

Polymorphism that gets resolved during compile time is known as **static polymorphism** or **compile time polymorphism**. This polymorphism is achieved using overloading of the methods in the same class, called as **Method overloading**.

Method overloading allows the programmer to have multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but differing in their signature.

Signature can differ by

-   the number of parameters
    
-   the data type of parameters
    
-   the order of the parameters
    

Note: We cannot overload methods by their return type, i.e., two or more methods are not overloaded if they differ only in their return type.

Similar to static polymorphism or compile time polymorphism, polymorphism can also be achieved at runtime. Such type of polymorphism is known as **dynamic polymorphism**. This type of polymorphism is achieved using overriding the parent method in the child class, called as **Method Overriding**.
