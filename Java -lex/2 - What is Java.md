We write programs in programming languages like Java which are called as **High-level programming languages**. But computers cannot understand high-level languages, they understand only **binary language**, i.e., 0's and 1's. This is the reason that every program that we write needs to get converted into binary form for the computer to understand.

This conversion is made possible using system software called **compilers and interpreters**.

In Java, the program (**source code**) written by the programmer gets compiled and converted into **byte code** (compiled code) by the Java compiler.

All the byte codes required for the program are then given to the interpreter. The interpreter reads the byte code line by line, converts it to binary form, also called as machine language or binary language, and then executes it.

This process requires some support and an environment for the execution to happen. **JDK** (Java Development Kit) helps in this for execution of a Java program. It provides library support and Java Runtime Environment (**JRE**), the environment for developing and executing Java based applications and programs

1.  In the code given above, the method is named as **main**. Every program in Java must have a main method as the code execution starts from the main method.  
    
2.  The method is defined using curly braces ({}). { signifies the start of a code block and } signifies its end.
    
3.  Every method in Java must be present inside a **class**. In the code given above, the class is named as Welcome. You will learn about classes and methods in detail later in the course.

-   Java compiler (**javac.exe**) - It is the primary Java compiler. The compiler accepts Java source code and produces Java bytecode conforming to the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS).
    
-   Java launcher (**java.exe**) - It helps in launching a Java application during execution.
    

Next, let us discuss about Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) contains Java Virtual Machine(JVM) and the Java standard library (Java Class Library).

-   Java Virtual Machine (**JVM**) - It is the virtual machine that enables the computer to run Java programs.
    
-   Java standard library (**Java Class Library**) - It is a set of dynamically loadable libraries that Java applications can call at run time. Java Platform is not dependent on a specific operating system and hence applications cannot rely on any of the platform-native libraries. So, the Java Platform provides a set of standard class libraries containing functions common to modern operating systems.



The Java source code is saved in a file with .java extension. When we compile a Java program (.java file), .class files (byte code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler (javac). These .class files go through various steps when we run the program as shown in the below diagram.
