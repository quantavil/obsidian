| They are defined in class but outside the body of methods. &nbsp;                                                                     | They are defined as a type of variable declared within programming blocks or subroutines.&nbsp;                                                                |
| These variables are created when an object is instantiated and are accessible to all constructors, methods, or blocks in class.&nbsp; | These variables are created when a block, method or constructor is started and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the block, method, or constructor. |
| These variables are destroyed when the object is destroyed. &nbsp;                                                                    | These variables are destroyed when the constructor or method is exited.                                                                                        |
| It can be accessed throughout the class. &nbsp;                                                                                       | Its access is limited to the method in which it is declared.                                                                                                   |
| They are used to reserving memory for data that the class needs and that too for the lifetime of the object.                          | They are used to decreasing dependencies between components I.e., the complexity of code is decreased.                                                         |
| These variables are given a default value if it is not assigned by code. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;                                   | These variables do not always have some value, so there must be a value assigned by code.                                                                      |
| It is not compulsory to initialize instance variables before use. &nbsp;                                                              | It is important to initialize local variables before use.                                                                                                      |
| It includes access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc. &nbsp;                                                          | It does not include any access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.                                                                              |
