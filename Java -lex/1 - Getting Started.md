A set of such instructions is known as a **program** and the act of creating a program is known as **programming**.

An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed by the computer while solving a problem. Algorithm should be represented into a form which others can easily understand. There are primarily two ways of representing an algorithm:

-   **Pseudo-code**: represents the algorithm in a way that is in between a programming language and English statements
    
-   **Flowchart**: represents the algorithm in a diagrammatic way

**Arithmetic operators:** Used for performing arithmetic operations

**Relational operators:** Also known as comparison operators, are used to compare values. Result of a relational operation is always either true or false.

**Logical operators:** are used to combine one or more relational operations.

Flowchart uses graphical symbols to depict steps. The most commonly used symbols in a flowchart are as follows:

## Control Structures

The statements which change the flow or order of execution of the instructions are called **control structures**.
There are three types of control structures:

-   Sequential
    
-   Selection
    
-   Iteration
