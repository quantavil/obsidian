### When is a good time to automate a test?

Under the following conditions, a test is worth automation.

- The test can be repeated.
- The tested feature's behavior does not change regularly.
- It takes time for a human tester.
- The test necessitates complex computations.
- The test confirms that the previous functionality did not break as a result of the new change.

### 2. When will you avoid automated testing?

Here are several circumstances in which a human tester can outperform an automated test suite in terms of software testing.

- The [software](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/programming-tutorial/what-is-software "software") or functionality under test changes regularly. It implies that you must frequently update your automated tests to keep them current. As a result, tests can soon become obsolete and cease to be useful.

Automation testing demands the use of different software tools or frameworks. There are numerous alternatives from which to choose. Here are some characteristics to consider when evaluating these tools.

- Tools that are programmable (code-based) or code-free: Some tools necessitate programming knowledge, while others do not, allowing a non-coder tester to generate test cases with visual aid.
- Open Source vs. Commercial: The pricing of the tools varies greatly depending on the features they provide. Commercial products can be costly, but you get tech assistance when you need it. Although open-source software is free, you must conduct research when troubleshooting issues.
- Simple to use: Some automated testing solutions are notoriously difficult to use and necessitate substantial training before they can provide any value. Some are simple to use and can be used right away.

### 4. Should you automate all testing?

Although there are benefits to test automation, it is impractical to automate all forms of testing. User interface testing, usability testing, and accessibility testing are some types of testing that can only be carried out by a human tester.

### 5. What is a test environment?

A computer or server can test software, which is referred to as a test environment. The tester installs the team's newly created software, complete with all of its dependencies, on this machine to simulate the production environment. As a result, the programme can be tested in a real-world situation.

### 6. What is browser automation?

The process of mechanically opening a [web application](https://www.simplilearn.com/progressive-web-apps-article "web application") in a browser and carrying out some more operations automatically is known as "browser automation."

### 7. What is cross-browser testing?

In cross-browser testing, a sort of automated browser testing, the tester determines whether or not the online application will function properly on different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and others.

### 8. Why do you need cross-browser testing?

You cannot control the browsers, platforms, or devices that your users may use to access your programme while using web apps. However, cross-browser testing guarantees that your web application will function across numerous platforms and devices using various iterations of popular web browsers.

### 9. What is automated regression testing?

In the Regression testing method, a tester ensures that no functionality from the old features has been broken. Its unique objective is to confirm that tested and developed functionality continues to function when a brand-new code has been added.

### 10. What are some of the best practices in test automation?

Here are a few best practices a team developing and testing software should follow to guarantee high-quality software.

- Select tasks to automate.
- Based on knowledge and expertise, assign test scenarios.
- Get rid of uncertainty.
- Select the appropriate tools and frameworks.
- Maintain test records in a database of bugs.

### 11. What is the test automation pyramid?

The test automation pyramid was initially developed by Martin Fowler and released in 2012. It is a method for figuring out how to employ the various types of testing automation most effectively. The test pyramid's fundamental tenet is to have a lot of [user interface](https://www.simplilearn.com/how-to-become-ui-ux-designer-article "user interface") (UI) unit tests and a lot fewer comprehensive UI tests.

### 12. How would you explain the meaning of Automation Testing?

Generally, any process that reduces human effort is termed as automation. Automation Testing is a process of using software, bots, or any method to perform repetitive tasks to eliminate errors, bugs, or find any vulnerabilities in the script.

Automation testing plays a very crucial role in the [software development](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/programming-tutorial/what-is-software-development "software development") process of continuous testing and continuous delivery when several updates are required regularly. Though in the software development process, testing is a separate field that requires expert professionals and the use of testing tools.
