Re-factoring is basically an activity that involves alteration or modification of the internal structure of software without any change in its external behaviors or functionality.

### Explain Agile Testing? What are the principles of Agile Testing?

Agile testing, as the name suggests, is a software testing process where software is tested for any defects, errors, or other issues. It is considered a core part of the development process as it enables testers and developers to work together as a team that in turn improves overall performance. It also helps in ensuring the successful delivery of high-quality products. Testing is usually performed so that testers can identify and resolve the problems early and at every point in the development process.

**Principles of Agile Testing** 

There are eight main principles of Agile Testing as given below:

- **Continuous Testing:** Testing should be conducted continuously by the Agile team to ensure continuous development progress.  
- **Continuous Feedback:** This process generally encourages taking feedback from clients to make sure that the product meets the requirements of the client or customer.  
- **Team Work or collective work:** Not only testers but developers, business analysts can also perform software testing or application testing.  
- **Clean Code:** Quality of software is maintained as the team tests the software to ensure that the code is clean, simple, and tight. All errors and defects that are found during the testing phase are fixed quickly within the same iteration by the Agile Team. 
- **Less Documentation:** This process usually involves the usage of reusable checklists instead of lengthy documentation.  
- **Test-Driven:** In other conventional methods, testing is only performed after the implementation but in agile testing, testing is done during the implementation so that errors or any issues can be removed on time.  
- **Customer Satisfaction:** During the agile testing process, development progress is being shown to clients or customers so that they can adapt and update their requirements. This is done to ensure customer satisfaction.
  
### What are advantages and disadvantages of Agile Process.

**Advantages** 

There are several advantages of using the Agile Process as given below: 

- Adapt well with changing requirements 
- Face-to-face conversation with team members and customers 
- Focuses on technical excellence and good design 
- Fast and continuous development  
- Enables collaboration and interaction between client and project team 
- Ensure and promote customer satisfaction 
- Faster feedback from customers or end-users 
- Quick identification and elimination of errors found in the code  
- Division of agile project into sprints or iterations i.e., short and repeatable phases typically 1-4 weeks long 
- Quick delivery of products  
- Easy to manage with more flexibility  
- The end goal can be unknown: Agile is beneficial for projects where the goal is not defined and as the project progresses, the goal becomes more evident. 

**Disadvantages** 

There are several disadvantages of using Agile Process as given below: 

- Lack of formal documentation and designing 
- Difficult to estimate resource requirement and effort  
- Not good for small development projects 
- Costly as compared to other development methodologies 
- Requires more time and energy from everyone 
- Risk of ever-lasting project 
- Difficult to scale large projects 
- Difficulty in testing and test construction
  
### Agile vs Waterfall

**Agile Methodology:**

1. **Iterative Development:**
   - Agile follows an iterative approach, where projects are divided into small, manageable units called sprints or iterations, typically lasting 2-4 weeks.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - Agile is highly flexible and adaptive to changes. Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams.

3. **Customer Collaboration:**
   - Emphasizes continuous customer involvement and feedback throughout the development process to ensure the final product meets user needs.

4. **Concurrent Testing:**
   - Testing is integrated into the development cycle, allowing for continuous improvement and early detection of defects.

5. **Team Communication:**
   - Promotes daily stand-up meetings and regular communication among team members to address issues promptly and ensure alignment.

**Waterfall Methodology:**

1. **Sequential Development:**
   - Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before the next begins (e.g., Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Maintenance).

2. **Rigid Structure:**
   - Waterfall is less flexible, with changes being difficult and costly to implement once the project is underway.

3. **Clear Documentation:**
   - Emphasizes thorough documentation at each stage, providing a clear and structured roadmap for the project.

4. **End-Stage Testing:**
   - Testing is conducted after the development phase is complete, which can delay the detection and resolution of defects.

5. **Minimal Customer Interaction:**
   - Customer involvement is typically limited to the initial requirements phase and the final delivery, reducing opportunities for feedback during development.

These points provide a concise comparison of Agile and Waterfall methodologies, highlighting their key differences in approach, flexibility, customer involvement, testing, and communication.

Understanding these concepts is essential for anyone involved in software development and testing to ensure high-quality software delivery.


SoapUI is a widely used open-source tool for testing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), particularly SOAP and REST web services. It allows for functional testing, load testing, and security testing of APIs, making it a comprehensive solution for ensuring the quality and performance of web services.

### Key Features of SoapUI:
1. **Functional Testing:** Create and execute automated functional tests for your APIs.
2. **Load Testing:** Simulate high load and stress conditions to check the performance and scalability of APIs.
3. **Security Testing:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in APIs.
4. **Service Mocking:** Mock web services to simulate responses from a web server.

### Steps for API Testing with SoapUI:

#### 1. Installing SoapUI:
   - Download and install SoapUI from the official website (https://www.soapui.org/downloads/).

#### 2. Creating a New Project:
   - Open SoapUI and create a new project by clicking on "File" > "New SOAP Project" for SOAP services or "File" > "New REST Project" for REST services.

#### 3. Adding an API Endpoint:
   - For a SOAP project, provide the WSDL (Web Services Description Language) URL.
   - For a REST project, provide the endpoint URL and resource path.

#### 4. Creating Test Requests:
   - Create a test request by adding a new request under the project. Specify the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and input any necessary parameters or headers.

#### 5. Configuring Assertions:
   - Add assertions to validate the response. Assertions can check for specific values, response time, HTTP status codes, and more.

#### 6. Running the Test:
   - Execute the test request and review the response. SoapUI provides a detailed log and response viewer to analyze the results.

#### Example: Testing a REST API with SoapUI

Let's go through an example of testing a REST API using SoapUI.

1. **Create a New REST Project:**
   - Open SoapUI.
   - Click on "File" > "New REST Project".
   - Enter the project name and the initial API endpoint URL (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`).

2. **Create a Test Suite:**
   - Right-click on the project and select "New TestSuite".
   - Name the TestSuite (e.g., "PostAPITests").

3. **Create a Test Case:**
   - Right-click on the TestSuite and select "New TestCase".
   - Name the TestCase (e.g., "GetPostsTest").

4. **Add a Test Step:**
   - Right-click on the TestCase and select "Add Step" > "REST Request".
   - Name the REST Request (e.g., "GetAllPosts").
   - Select the method (GET) and enter the resource path (`/posts`).

5. **Execute the Request:**
   - Click on the "Submit" button to execute the request.
   - SoapUI will display the response in the response window.

6. **Add Assertions:**
   - In the response window, click on the "Assertions" tab.
   - Add assertions to validate the response (e.g., "Contains" to check if the response contains a specific string, or "Valid HTTP Status Codes" to ensure the status code is 200).

#### Example Response:
```json
[
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Sample Post Title",
    "body": "This is a sample post body."
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Another Post Title",
    "body": "This is another sample post body."
  }
]
```

#### Adding Assertions:
- **Contains Assertion:** Verify the response contains `"userId": 1`.
  - Click on "Add Assertion" > "Property Content" > "Contains".
  - Enter `"userId": 1` in the dialog box.

- **Valid HTTP Status Codes Assertion:** Ensure the response status is 200.
  - Click on "Add Assertion" > "Status Codes".
  - Enter `200` in the dialog box.

By following these steps, you can effectively use SoapUI to test REST APIs, ensuring they function correctly and meet the specified requirements. The same principles apply to SOAP API testing, with the primary difference being the use of WSDL for defining the service interface.

## Functional vs Automation
### Functional Testing

**Functional Testing** is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose is to ensure that the software behaves as expected and performs all its intended functions correctly.

#### Key Aspects of Functional Testing:
1. **Requirements-based Testing:**
   - Tests are based on the functional requirements specified in the software documentation.
2. **User-focused:**
   - Ensures that the application provides the desired functionalities to the end user.
3. **Black Box Testing:**
   - Testers do not need to know the internal code structure; they focus on input and output.

#### Example of Functional Testing:
Let's say you are testing a login feature of a web application.

**Steps:**
1. **Test Case: Verify the login with valid credentials**
   - **Input:**
     - Username: `validUser`
     - Password: `validPassword`
   - **Expected Output:**
     - The user should be redirected to the dashboard page.

2. **Test Case: Verify the login with invalid credentials**
   - **Input:**
     - Username: `invalidUser`
     - Password: `invalidPassword`
   - **Expected Output:**
     - An error message should be displayed, stating "Invalid username or password."

3. **Test Case: Verify the login with empty fields**
   - **Input:**
     - Username: ``
     - Password: ``
   - **Expected Output:**
     - An error message should be displayed, stating "Username and password are required."

### Automation Testing

**Automation Testing** is a software testing technique that uses automated tools and scripts to perform tests. It aims to reduce the time and effort involved in manual testing by executing repetitive test cases automatically.

#### Key Aspects of Automation Testing:
1. **Script-based:**
   - Test cases are written in a programming or scripting language and executed using an automation tool.
2. **Efficiency:**
   - Significantly reduces testing time, especially for regression and load testing.
3. **Repeatability:**
   - Ensures consistent test execution, reducing the likelihood of human error.

#### Example of Automation Testing:
Using Selenium WebDriver with Java to automate the login feature of a web application.

**Steps:**
1. **Setup the Selenium WebDriver environment:**
   - Install Java, Selenium WebDriver, and a suitable IDE (e.g., Eclipse).

2. **Write the automation script:**

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class LoginTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set the path to the ChromeDriver executable
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver");
        
        // Initialize a ChromeDriver instance
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        
        // Navigate to the login page
        driver.get("https://example.com/login");
        
        // Find the username and password fields and the login button
        WebElement usernameField = driver.findElement(By.id("username"));
        WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id("password"));
        WebElement loginButton = driver.findElement(By.id("loginButton"));
        
        // Input valid credentials and click the login button
        usernameField.sendKeys("validUser");
        passwordField.sendKeys("validPassword");
        loginButton.click();
        
        // Verify the user is redirected to the dashboard
        String expectedUrl = "https://example.com/dashboard";
        String actualUrl = driver.getCurrentUrl();
        
        if (actualUrl.equals(expectedUrl)) {
            System.out.println("Login test passed.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Login test failed.");
        }
        
        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Setup:**
   - The script sets the path to the ChromeDriver executable and initializes a ChromeDriver instance to control the browser.

2. **Navigation:**
   - The script navigates to the login page of the web application.

3. **Interaction:**
   - The script finds the username and password input fields and the login button using their HTML element IDs.
   - It inputs valid credentials and clicks the login button.

4. **Verification:**
   - The script checks the URL of the current page to verify that the user has been redirected to the dashboard.

5. **Cleanup:**
   - The script closes the browser.

By automating this test case, you can quickly and repeatedly verify the login functionality, ensuring that changes in the application do not break the expected behavior.

### Summary
- **Functional Testing** ensures that software functions as intended based on requirements, often performed manually.
- **Automation Testing** uses scripts and tools to automate repetitive tests, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. 

Both types of testing are crucial for delivering high-quality software.
