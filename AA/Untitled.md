### Functional Testing

Functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the functionality of a system or application based on its specifications. The primary goal is to ensure that the software behaves as expected and meets the requirements outlined in its design. It focuses on what the system does, rather than how it does it, and verifies that all features and functionalities work correctly from the user's perspective.

Functional testing can be categorized into various types based on the scope and objectives of the testing. Here are some common types:

1. **Unit Testing**: This type of testing involves testing individual units or components of the software in isolation, typically at the code level. It ensures that each unit functions correctly as per its design.

2. **Integration Testing**: Integration testing verifies that individual units or modules work together as expected when integrated into larger components or the system as a whole. It validates the interactions and interfaces between different parts of the software.

3. **System Testing**: System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole to ensure that all components work together properly and meet the specified requirements. It tests the system in an environment that closely resembles the production environment.

4. **Acceptance Testing**: Acceptance testing, also known as user acceptance testing (UAT), is conducted to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. It involves testing the software with real users or stakeholders to validate its usability and suitability for its intended purpose.

5. **Regression Testing**: Regression testing ensures that recent changes or enhancements to the software have not adversely affected existing functionalities. It involves retesting previously tested features to detect any regressions or unintended side effects.

6. **Smoke Testing**: Smoke testing, also known as build verification testing, is performed to quickly evaluate whether the critical functionalities of the software are working correctly before more comprehensive testing is carried out. It helps in identifying fundamental issues early in the development process.

7. **Sanity Testing**: Sanity testing is a narrow and focused form of regression testing that verifies whether specific areas of the software have been fixed or modified correctly after a new build or release. It aims to quickly determine if the application is stable enough for further testing.

### Automation testing 

Automation testing involves using software tools to execute pre-scripted tests on a software application to verify its functionality, performance. It aims to streamline the testing process, reduce manual effort, and increase the efficiency and accuracy of testing tasks. Automation testing is particularly beneficial for repetitive test cases, regression testing, and scenarios that require testing across multiple platforms or configurations.

Here are some common types of automation testing:

1. **Functional Automation Testing**: This type of automation testing involves automating test cases that verify the functional aspects of the software application. It includes validating user interfaces, business logic, data manipulation, and other functional requirements. Tools like Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, and TestComplete are commonly used for functional automation testing.

2. **Regression Testing**: Regression testing involves re-running previously executed test cases to ensure that recent changes or enhancements to the software have not introduced new defects or caused regressions in existing functionalities. Automation is highly beneficial for regression testing, as it allows for quick and thorough validation of multiple test cases across different builds or versions of the software.

3. **Load and Performance Testing**: Load and performance testing assess the behavior of the software application under various load conditions, such as high user traffic or data volume. Automation tools like JMeter, LoadRunner, and Gatling are used to simulate thousands of virtual users accessing the application simultaneously, measuring response times, throughput, and resource utilization to identify performance bottlenecks and scalability issues.

4. **API Testing**: API testing involves testing the application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow different software systems to communicate and interact with each other. Automation tools such as Postman, SoapUI, and REST Assured are used to automate API calls, validate responses, and verify the functionality, reliability, and security of APIs.

5. **GUI Testing**: GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing focuses on testing the graphical elements and user interface of the software application. Automation tools like Selenium WebDriver, TestComplete, and Katalon Studio can automate interactions with the GUI elements, such as buttons, menus, forms, and dialog boxes, to validate their behavior and appearance across different browsers and platforms.

6. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Cross-browser testing involves testing the compatibility of the software application across different web browsers and browser versions. Automation tools like Selenium WebDriver and TestComplete support cross-browser testing by allowing testers to automate test scripts and execute them across multiple browsers simultaneously, ensuring consistent behavior and user experience.

7. **Mobile Testing**: Mobile testing involves testing the functionality, usability, and performance of mobile applications across various devices, operating systems, and screen sizes.

### QA Methodologies
QA (Quality Assurance) methodologies are structured approaches to ensure that software meets specified requirements and standards. They focus on preventing defects through planned and systematic activities, including:

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Testers manually execute test cases without the use of automation tools to ensure software functionality.

2. **Automation Testing:**
   - Automated tools are used to execute pre-scripted tests on the software to compare actual outcomes with expected outcomes.

3. **Black Box Testing:**
   - Testing the software from an external perspective without knowledge of its internal code or structure.

4. **White Box Testing:**
   - Testing based on knowledge of the internal logic and structure of the code.

5. **Integration Testing:**
   - Verifying the interfaces and interactions between integrated components or systems.

6. **Regression Testing:**
   - Re-running previously completed tests to ensure that changes or additions have not broken any existing functionality.


### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
SDLC is a framework that defines the steps involved in the development of software applications, ensuring high quality and correctness. The stages typically include:

1. **Planning:**
   - Define project goals, scope, resources, and schedule.

2. **Requirements Analysis:**
   - Gather and analyze user requirements to create detailed documentation.

3. **Design:**
   - Develop the architecture and design specifications for the software.

4. **Implementation (Coding):**
   - Write the actual code based on the design specifications.

5. **Testing:**
   - Execute test cases to identify and fix defects, ensuring the software meets requirements.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Release the software to production.

7. **Maintenance:**
   - Provide ongoing support and make necessary updates or improvements.

### STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
STLC is a sequence of specific activities conducted during the testing process to ensure software quality. The stages typically include:

1. **Requirement Analysis:**
   - Understand and analyze testing requirements from the software requirements documentation.

2. **Test Planning:**
   - Create a test plan, define the scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and test strategy.

3. **Test Case Development:**
   - Design and develop test cases and test scripts based on requirements.

4. **Environment Setup:**
   - Set up the necessary hardware and software environment for testing.

5. **Test Execution:**
   - Execute test cases and report defects.

6. **Test Closure:**
   - Conclude testing activities, analyze test results, and prepare a test summary report.

### Defect Life Cycle
The Defect Life Cycle, also known as Bug Life Cycle, is the process through which a defect goes from identification to resolution. The stages typically include:

1. **Identification:**
   - A defect is discovered and reported with details such as steps to reproduce, severity, and priority.

2. **Assignment:**
   - The defect is assigned to a developer or team for analysis and resolution.

3. **Fixing:**
   - The developer works on the defect to fix the underlying issue.

4. **Verification:**
   - The tester verifies that the defect has been fixed by re-executing the relevant test cases.

5. **Closure:**
   - Once the defect is confirmed as fixed, it is marked as closed. If the defect persists, it may be reopened for further investigation.

6. **Deferred:**
   - In some cases, a defect may be deferred to a future release if it is not critical for the current release.
