### Functional Testing

Functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the functionality of a system or application based on its specifications. The primary goal is to ensure that the software behaves as expected and meets the requirements outlined in its design. It focuses on what the system does, rather than how it does it, and verifies that all features and functionalities work correctly from the user's perspective.

Functional testing can be categorized into various types based on the scope and objectives of the testing. Here are some common types:

1. **Unit Testing**: This type of testing involves testing individual units or components of the software in isolation, typically at the code level. It ensures that each unit functions correctly as per its design.

2. **Integration Testing**: Integration testing verifies that individual units or modules work together as expected when integrated into larger components or the system as a whole. It validates the interactions and interfaces between different parts of the software.

3. **System Testing**: System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole to ensure that all components work together properly and meet the specified requirements. It tests the system in an environment that closely resembles the production environment.

4. **Acceptance Testing**: Acceptance testing, also known as user acceptance testing (UAT), is conducted to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment. It involves testing the software with real users or stakeholders to validate its usability and suitability for its intended purpose.

5. **Regression Testing**: Regression testing ensures that recent changes or enhancements to the software have not adversely affected existing functionalities. It involves retesting previously tested features to detect any regressions or unintended side effects.

6. **Smoke Testing**: Smoke testing, also known as build verification testing, is performed to quickly evaluate whether the critical functionalities of the software are working correctly before more comprehensive testing is carried out. It helps in identifying fundamental issues early in the development process.

7. **Sanity Testing**: Sanity testing is a narrow and focused form of regression testing that verifies whether specific areas of the software have been fixed or modified correctly after a new build or release. It aims to quickly determine if the application is stable enough for further testing.
