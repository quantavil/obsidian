Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language  It is platform-independent due to its use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java programs to run on any device or operating system that has the JVM installed. Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android), web servers, and embedded systems.

### Can java be said to be the complete object-oriented programming language?

Java is not considered a purely object-oriented programming language because it uses primitive data types (such as int, char, etc.) which are not objects. In a purely object-oriented language, everything would be an object. Despite this, Java is highly object-oriented and supports key OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.


### Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in java. And how java utilizes this.

Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every individual program. And it was fixed. On the other hand, Heap memory is the portion that was not allocated to the java program but it will be available for use by the java program when it is required, mostly during the runtime of the program.

### What do you understand by an instance variable and a local variable?

An instance variable is a variable that is defined within a class and is associated with an instance of that class. Each object of the class has its own copy of the instance variable, and it is used to store the state of the object.

A local variable is a variable that is declared within a method, constructor, or block and is only accessible within that method, constructor, or block. Local variables are not visible outside of their scope and are used for temporary storage of data needed only within the method's execution.
