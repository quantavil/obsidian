## Wiki Editing Guide

**1.** You can edit the wiki via [GitHub](<https://rentry.co/FMHYedit>). Approved changes will be applied to [Reddit](<https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki>) and all [Backups](<https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/backups>).
**2.** <#01G7ZJBH9F2748WWYAZKEM6N41> fills up pretty quickly, so we can always use help moving stuff over from it.
**3.**  Before adding something, check [this list](<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nbats/FMHYedit/main/single-page>) to be sure we don't already have it. It's easiest to ctrl+f a sites URL or name. 
**4.** Feel free to organize, correct or change anything you feel could be improved.
**5.** Ping a mod if you have any questions, or can't figure out which category something belongs in.
**6.** Use these 3 shortcuts in [Clippings](<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clippings/>) to make formatting quicker:

`* []() -`
`, []()`
`or []()`

You can [import](<https://mega.nz/file/TzR1QQrS#nt8yeL4qjok-NQAjB753n71rNEYN2-I4iUlUX4Pm0mE>) these and add shortcuts via clippings "organize clippings" menu on right click. The default command is alt+shift+y.

**What other Divolt servers can I join?** 
[Slavart](https://slavart.divolt.xyz/) / [M4D](https://m4d.divolt.xyz/) / [Gamesdrive](https://gamesdrive.divolt.xyz/) / [CrackSupport](https://cracksupport.divolt.xyz/) / [CrackHub](https://cracksupport.divolt.xyz/) / [No Bucks Given](<https://divolt.xyz/invite/BM9hvM0E>)

**How do I view encoded links?**
You can use a [base64 decoder](<https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/storage#wiki_encode_.2F_decode_urls>) or [script](<https://pastebin.com/raw/HVAWhmG5>). If it won't let you copy on mobile try [troddit](<https://www.troddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/base64>).

**What is the difference between DDL and Torrenting?**
**Direct downloads** (DDL) are files contained on a server. They can be downloaded via a browser, but its recommended to use a [manager](<https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/storage#wiki_file_download_managers>) to make handling links easier. 
***
**Torrents** are files that exist not on servers, but on peoples computers. In order to download a torrent you need both a [client](<https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/torrent#wiki_.25BA_torrent_clients>) and a [VPN](<https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/adblock-vpn-privacy#wiki_.25BA_vpn>) to mask your IP. While connected to a torrent, you not only download parts of the file(s) from others, but they download parts from you. This is considered sharing files illegally in most countries and can get you in trouble with your ISP, unlike DDL and streaming sites.



**Move Sites from Queue to Wiki**
<https://divolt.xyz/server/01FVKH3QTSZYE1N507J615RW4R/channel/01G8MEA67KTSAZJ9RQ1TXCBHR9/01G8MEW3S9QHE50BHNKHKPX9HX>
