###### Do you remember those browser games you used to play after coming home from school? Even after the Adobe decision you can still play them, and that is what this guide will explain.

## Bluemaxima's Flashpoint
Bluemaxima's Flashpoint is a browser game preservation project. You can download it by visiting this site: 
[Bluemaxima's Flashpoint Download](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/)
!!! note Install Flashpoint Ultimate if you want all the games on your HD, or Infinity if you just want to download the game online and then play offline.
I'll use Flashpoint Core as an example:

Now you can play any game you want.

## FlashPatch
with FlashPatch you can play any browser flash game again. If you want to install it go to the github repo:
[FlashPatch](https://github.com/darktohka/FlashPatch)
!!! note You will need Adobe Flash Player. To install it you can download the Archive.org version from here: [Adobe Flash Player](https://web.archive.org/web/20201220001753/http://fpdownload.adobe.com/get/flashplayer/pdc/32.0.0.465/install_flash_player.exe) or you can download the Chinese version, which is the most up-to-date, here: [Chinese Adobe Flash Player](https://github.com/CleanFlash/installer)
![FlashPatch](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/aa4daf4d98cc52f6cf711d28e8fdbead80a62659cac334f078b0b818466f44dd/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f39426b43394c352e706e67)

## Adobe Flash Player Projector
If you want to play flash games offline just by needing the file, you can use the Adobe Flash Player Projector. You can install it here:
[Adobe Flash Player Projector]( https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html)
![Install Adobe Flash Player Projector](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/892251917076541510/892252358740955237/unknown.png?width=400&height=267)
select one of the versions depending on your operating system.

![Adobe Flash Player Projector](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/892251917076541510/892253185736056852/unknown.png?width=840&height=427)
![Adobe Flash Player Projector](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/892251917076541510/892253399020605440/unknown.png?width=308&height=158)
will appear something like this. After that, to run the .SWF file of the game, go to "Archive > Open... > Search..." and open the game. You can also run directly from the URL.

This is an example of a game running on the Adobe Flash Player Projector:
