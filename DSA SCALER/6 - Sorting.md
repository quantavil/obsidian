### Example

-   **Dictionary:** The dictionary stores words in alphabetical order so that searching for any word becomes easy.
-   **Telephone Book:** The telephone book stores the telephone numbers of people sorted by their names in alphabetical order, so that the names can be searched easily.
-   **E-commerce application:** While shopping through any e-commerce application like amazon or flipkart, etc. , we preferably tend to sort our items based on their price range, popularity, size, etc.

Also, the sorting algorithm's real-life usage is just miraculous! For example --

-   **Quick sort** is used for updating the real-time scores of various sports.
-   **Bubble sort** is used in TV to sort the channels based on audience viewing timings.
-   **Merge Sort** is very popularly used by databases to load a huge amount of data.


**Time complexity Notations:** These are the asymptotic notations that are used for calculating the time complexity of the sorting algorithms:

1.  **Big oh Notation, O:** It measures the upper limit of an algorithm's running time or the worst-case time complexity. It is known by *O(n)* for input size 'n'.
2.  **Omega Notation, Ω:** It measures the minimum time taken by algorithms to execute, and calculates the best case time complexity in sorting. It is known by *Ω(n)* for input size 'n'.
3.  **Theta Notation, θ:** It measures the average time taken by an algorithm to execute. Or, the lower bound and upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It is known by *θ(n)* for input size 'n'.
