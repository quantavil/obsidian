## What is a tree data structure?

§ Tree is a recursive, non-linear data structure consisting of the set of one or more data nodes where one node is designated as the root and the remaining nodes are called as the children of the root.

§ Tree organizes data into hierarchial manner.

§ The most commonly used tree data structure is a binary tree and its variants.

§ Example : filesystem, comments in social media

## What are Binary trees?

§ A binary Tree is a special type of tree where each node can have at most two children. Binary tree is generally partitioned into three disjoint subsets, i.e. the root of the tree, left sub-tree and right sub-tree.

## What are tree traversals?

§ Tree traversal is a process of visiting all the nodes of a tree. Since root (head) is the first node and all nodes are connected via edges (or links) we always start with that node. There are three ways which we use to traverse a tree −

1. **Inorder Traversal:**  Left-root-right

2. **Preorder Traversal:**  root-Left-right

3. **Postorder Traversal:** Left-right-root

## What is a Binary Search Tree?

A binary search tree (BST) is a variant of binary tree data structure that stores data in a very efficient manner such that the values of the nodes in the left sub-tree are less than the value of the root node, and the values of the nodes on the right of the root node are correspondingly higher than the root.

## What is a graph data structure?

Graph is a type of non-linear data structure that consists of vertices or nodes connected by edges or links for storing data. Edges connecting the nodes may be directed or undirected.
