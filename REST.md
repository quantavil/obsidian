## Introduction to REST Assured

### REST architecture

-   REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
-   REST is a software architecture style that relies on a stateless communications protocol, most commonly, HTTP.
-   REST structures message data in XML, YAML or any other format that is machine-readable. JSON is now the most popular format being used in REST Services.
-   In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and the REST client accesses and presents the resources. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ Global IDs. 

### URI – Uniform Resource Identifier

-   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a resource. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network.
-   Each resource is identified by one or more Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). To access the resource, an application calls an HTTP operation(Method) on one of the resource's URIs.

### RESTFul services

-   Web services based on REST Architecture are known as RESTful Web Services.
-   These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), which is a service that provides resource representation in JSON format using HTTP Methods
