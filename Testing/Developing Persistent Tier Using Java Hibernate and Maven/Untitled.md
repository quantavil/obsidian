The persistence phenomenon consists of three core components: **data, medium and storage**

1.  The **data** that needs to be persisted can be:
    
    -   **Raw data:** which is collected from a file or any other source in the form of bytes.
        
    -   **Java object:** which is the data contained in the object of a Java class.
        
2.  To persist the data, Java provides **media** like : %%how to persist%%
    
    -   I/O Streams and Serialization
        
    -   JDBC
        
    -   ORM Frameworks like Hibernate
        
3.  RAM or secondary **storage** device like hard drive can be used to persist the data. Additionally, logical storage devices like Database or file system(local and remote) can also be used as a placeholder for the data.
    

In this course, we will focus on **how to persist** data.
