## Benefits:

-   100% code coverage is always achieved.
    
-   TDD makes the developer focus on the requirements before writing the code.
    
-   There is a drastic reduction in the number of defects at later stages of application development.
    
-   Even though there is a moderate increase in development effort initially (writing tests), overall project effort/cost savings justify it by a significant margin.
