## Benefits:

-   100% code coverage is always achieved.
    
-   TDD makes the developer focus on the requirements before writing the code.
    
-   There is a drastic reduction in the number of defects at later stages of application development.
    
-   Even though there is a moderate increase in development effort initially (writing tests), overall project effort/cost savings justify it by a significant margin.

## ATDD
Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) methodology was a result of the natural evolution of TDD.It involves driving the entire application development by acceptance tests rather than requirement specifications to bring in the business analysts/customer perspective too.
