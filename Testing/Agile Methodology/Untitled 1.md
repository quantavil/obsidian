Agile is a software development process framework which defines a set of principles under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collective effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams.

### When to use Agile?

Agile is preferred over traditional models of software development, like waterfall, if the project has any of the following characteristics: 

- Lack of clearly defined requirements due to
-   Aggressive deadlines
    

Introduction to Agile:
----------------------

Traditional Software development process:
-----------------------------------------

Requirement analysis
   Design (make a plan)
   	development ( coding)
 			Testing       
				deployment
					maintainance

When to use?
------------
* clear requirement from client
* enough time to develop the project
* already known or experienced project

Disadvantage:
-------------
1. customer unsatisfaction
2. we loss our reputation
3. loss of money
4. waste of time.


When to use Agile:
-------------
Agile is the software development process, which we have to follow when there is 
* no clear requirement from client
* Complexity of the software is high
* project is entirely new to the IT Field.
* short period of time to deliver the project (Aggressive deadlines)





    Traditional                                     Agile

* developer and tester are				* developer and tester are 									           
from different team					  consider as same team 

* Test planning a month              * test plan will carried out during
  before                             testing day or a day before 
	
* there is no transparency           * there is transparency between the team
  between developer and               like about the bug they rised etc..
  tester

* manual testing skill is            * Automation testing skill is required
 sufficient to test the               to complete the project on time, because
software                              we have less period of time.

* No customer feedback               * Change Acceptance
* Missing or inconsistent delivery   * Well collaborated approach
													* Users stories driven approach
													* Mid course correction and feedback
													* Increased productivity
													* Product development over documentation
When to use Agile?
Lack of clarity defined require ments due to:
If the project has - high degree of complexity (unique identifiction of citizents)
High degree of novelty - completely new idea
Aggressive Deadline


Agile Manifesto:
----------------

* Individual and interaction over process and tools:
---------------------------------------------------
     Instead of communicating through outlook, teams, sykpe which will lead
to misunderstanding or time delay. Have a interaction between the people


* Working software over comprehensive documentation:
----------------------------------------------------
     Instead of showing some document to the client, show the working model
of some functionality. this will increase the confidence to the client


* Customer collabration over contract negotiation:
--------------------------------------------------
     Instead of making contract with client, add one client person in our team. 
incase of any doubts in requirment we can get the clarification from the client side.


* Responding to change over following a plan:
---------------------------------------------
	   Instead of following a plan we need to respond to the change.


Scrum Method:
=============
   * suitable for team having 5-7 members
   * we have daily scrum meeting about 20-30mins



Sprint:  ( repeatable)
-------


instagram ---> login, message portal, post, making reels,
					 video call, like, comment, live, follow, followers.
               photo filters, etc....


Scrum Team:
===========
* self organizing team
* works as single unit
* always looking to adapt changes
* at end of sprint the aim to deliver the working product


Advantages of scrum methodology:
--------------------------------

* end the sprint we deliver the working product in a short span of time
* eliminates the communication barrier
* all the work is visible among the team
* it ensure that we are effectively using time, money and people.


Rules of scrum:
===============

* complete transparency:
------------------------
      if any defect rise in the project, everyone from the team must aware about the bug that rised by the tester.

* Diligent Inspection:
----------------------
     * Project requirement is incompleted, may be changes are there to create
a product out of requirement.
     * inorder to avoid, regular inspection is needed.
     * inspection is done by experienced people from the team


* Adaptation:
-------------
     * if any deviation is found, the team should ready to accept those changes and work on it.
     * and fix the changes as soon as possible

* Common definition "Done":
---------------------------
	* once developer completed the development work, he/she should update the status "done"
   * once tester completed the testing work, he/she should update the status
as "done".


Events in Scrum:
----------------

Sprint:
------ 
   * 15-20days
   * in each sprint we gonna work on new functionality.
   * at end the aim to deliver the working software
   * once the sprint is completed, another sprint will start immediately.


Sprint planning:
----------------
    * 8 hours
    * it will carried at the start of the each sprint
    * the product we are gonna deliver
    * how to complete the work


Daily scrum:
------------
   * 15min/ per day
   * what we did yesterday
   * what we are doing now
   * what we are gonna do tomorrow
   * difficulties faced in the project


Sprint review:
--------------
   * 4hours
   * whether we achieved the goal
   * any deviation from the requirement
   * status of sprint


sprint retrospective:
---------------------
	* 3hours
   * any improvement need in upcoming sprint
   * any improvement needed in project
   * analysis the feedback of previous sprint


Artifacts:
==========

product backlog:
----------------
* list of function, requirments, feature etc..
* high priority order items
* information about team members
* effort esimation, cost esimation 
* remaining pending works.


Sprint backlog:
--------------
* for each sprint we have individual sprint backlog
* who is working on that particular functionality
* dynamic document, it can changes any time during daily scrum.
* visible to entire scrum team
* remaining pending works regarding to current sprint.



Scrum Team:
===========
* Product owner
* Development team
* Scrum Master
* Scrum Mentor (optional)

developers and testers are addressed as development team in scrum.

Product Owner:
-------------
* creating product blacklog based on user requirement and their priorities
* PO is ensure that it is accessible, transparent and clear
* explain the documnet to the developement team
* responsible for doing inspection while developing the product
* keep tracking the overall work.

Development team:
-----------------
* should ready to accept the changes 
* end result must be "done" is the goal for the team


* There is no separate designation for tester in development team. Tester 
also consider as developers.

* we are working in the project that have short span of deadline as well as
no clear requirement. we need tester who is having automation testing skill

* the sprint goal for tester is "Done".

Scrum Master:
-------------
* responsible to check whether team is following scrum methodology or not
* make the team interactive and add values for unproductive scrum event
* trains the new member of the team about scrum methodology.




Traditional:  Design | Code  | Tester | Deployment | Maintenance

Agile:  Design | Developer + Tester | Deployment

Devops:  Developer + Tester + deployment
