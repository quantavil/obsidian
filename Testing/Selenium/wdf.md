Selenium is a suite of tools which can automate actions on web browsers. Each tool is developed to support a specific kind of automation approach.

### The three important tools that form the core of selenium ecosystem are

**Selenium IDE**
-   Users are new to selenium and/or have no prior knowledge in programming.
-   Automated test scripts have to be created in the quickest possible way.
-   Cross-browser testing is not possible
- Selenium IDE cannot be integrated with any other tools

**Selenium WebDriver**
-   Skilled programmers, who can handle code using object-oriented APIs, are available.
-   Test automation involves complex functionalities liek UIs built using HTML5, AJAX and also while testing in headless browsers (HTMLUnit).
-   Developing advanced automation frameworks which needs features like
    -   Customized results reporting
    -   Portability across browsers and operating systems.
- Selenium WebDriver tests can be integrated with tools like Cucumber , JIRA, Jenkins
**Selenium Grid**
-   Multiple tests have to be run in parallel on multiple machines to reduce overall execution time.
-   Tests need to be distributed across multiple machines to check for application compatibility with different OS-Browser combinations.
