Software quality is the degree to which a process, component or system conforms to the specified requirements and user expectations.

## Characteristics of Software Quality

As per ISO standard model (ISO/IEC 9126), the quality of a software can be evaluated based on its following characteristics.

## Software Testing

Software testing is an activity (or set of activities) performed to compare the expected outcome with the actual outcome of one specific task in the system, component or process and report the defects found in the system.

## Defect

A defect is a fault in the system, component or process due to which the expected outcome and the actual outcome of a test activity do not match.  
The other terms used to refer to a defect are bug, error, anomaly, etc.

**Software Testing** is the generic term applied to all the activities that are performed to ensure that the quality characteristics of the software meet the required/expected standards. 

**The objective of software testing is to eliminate defects in a software by**

1.  Preventing defects from entering the software
    
2.  Identifying and reporting the defects existing in the software

## Catgeorization

At a very high level tests are categorized as

-   **Formal tests** : Tests that document their expected results, actual results and defects found.
    
-   **Informal tests** : Tests that are not documented completely.
