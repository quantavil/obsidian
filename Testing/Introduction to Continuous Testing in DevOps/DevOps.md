The name DevOps is derived from combination of Development + Operations.

## Need For DevOps

The most common requirement for software changes are:

-   Unpredictable time of occurrence.
    
-   Quick deployment of software changes.

The ability of an organization to thrive in an environment, that requires it to respond to all the unanticipated changes as quickly as possible, is called as **Business agility**.

DevOps can be any initiative which is focused on enabling business agility by:

-   Eliminating barriers between development team and operations team in agile projects to eliminate delays
-   Moving deliverables through all phases development life cycle faster
-   Ensuring, always there is no compromise on deliverable quality.

## The Team Structure in DevOps

**Characteristics**

-   **Resource utilization**: The QA team needs to wait during the time the development team is coding. The operations team need to wait until the QA team finishes testing.
    
-   **Inter-team relationship**: Since each team has its own specific goals and timelines to meet, conflicts are bound to happen. Whenever there are defects or missed deadlines, each team blame the others. This results in loss of productive time which is spent on conflict resolution.
    
-   **Turnaround time**: Since there are two levels of inter-team handovers involved, there is additional time consumed at each level for documentation, reviews and sign-offs.
