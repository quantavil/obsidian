_C has many built-in operators and can be classified into 6 types:_

1.  **Arithmetic Operators**
2.  **Relational Operators**
3.  **Logical Operators**
4.  **Bitwise Operators**
5.  **Assignment Operators**
6.  **Other Operators**

## **1. Arithmetic Operators:** 

These operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: `(+, -, *, /, %,++,–)` Arithmetic operators are of two types: 

### **a) Unary Operators**: 

Operators that operate or work with a single operand are unary operators. For example: Increment(++) and Decrement(–) Operators

```cpp
int val = 5;
int res ;

res = ++val;
cout<<val << " " << res << endl;  // 6
```

### **b) Binary Operators**:

Operators that operate or work with two operands are binary operators. For example: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), multiplication(*), Division(/) operators

int a = 7;
int b = 2;
cout<<a+b; // 9
