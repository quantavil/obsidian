_C has many built-in operators and can be classified into 6 types:_

1.  **Arithmetic Operators**
2.  **Relational Operators**
3.  **Logical Operators**
4.  **Bitwise Operators**
5.  **Assignment Operators**
6.  **Other Operators**

## **1. Arithmetic Operators:** 

These operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: `(+, -, *, /, %,++,–)` Arithmetic operators are of two types: 

### **a) Unary Operators**: 

Operators that operate or work with a single operand are unary operators. For example: Increment(++) and Decrement(–) Operators

```cpp
int val = 5;
int res ;

res = ++val;
cout<<val << " " << res << endl;  // 6 6

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

int val = 5;
int res ;

res = val++;
cout<<val << " " << res << endl;  // 6 5
```

### **b) Binary Operators**:

Operators that operate or work with two operands are binary operators. For example: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), multiplication(*), Division(/) operators

```cpp
int a = 7;
int b = 2;
cout<<a+b; // 9
```

## **2. Relational Operators:**

These are used for the comparison of the values of two operands.

`==, >= , <=` 

```cpp
int a = 3;
int b = 5;
cout<<(a < b);
// operator to check if a is smaller than b
```

## **3. Logical Operators:**

Logical Operators are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a Boolean value either **true** or **false**.

```cpp
cout<<((4 != 5) && (4 < 5));     // true
```
