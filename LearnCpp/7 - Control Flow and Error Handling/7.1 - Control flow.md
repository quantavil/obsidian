# 7.1A - Categories of flow control statements
Fortunately, C++ provides a number of different control flow statements (also called flow control statements), which are statements that allow the programmer to change the normal path of execution through the program



| Category | Meaning | Implementated in C++ by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conditional statements | Conditional statements cause a sequence of code to execute only if some condition is met. | If, switch |
| Jumps | Jumps tell the CPU to start executing the statements at some other location. | Goto, break, continue |
| Function calls | Function calls are jumps to some other location and back. | Function calls, return |
| Loops | Loops tell the program to repeatedly execute some sequence of code zero or more times, until some condition is met. | While, do-while, for, ranged-for |
| Halts | Halts tell the program to quit running. | std::exit(), std::abort() |
| Exceptions | Exceptions are a special kind of flow control structure designed for error handling. | Try, throw, catch |

A conditional statement is a statement that specifies whether some associated statement(s) should be executed or not.

## If statements and blocks

```cpp
if (condition)
    true_statement;
else
    false_statement;
```

is actually the equivalent of:

```cpp
if (condition)
{
    true_statement;
}
else
{
    false_statement;
}
```

**Example :**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter your height (in cm): ";
    int x{};
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x > 140)
        std::cout << "You are tall enough to ride.\n";
    else if (x < 140 & x >= 50 )
    { // note addition of block here
	    if (x % 2 == 0) {
		    ; // this is a null statement
	    }
        else {
	        std::cout << "You are Odd one \n";
	    }
    } // Remember that blocks are treated as a single statement, so this now works as expected:
    else 
        std::cout << "You are not tall enough to ride.\n";

    std::cout << "Too bad!\n"; // This line will always execulte

    return 0;
}
```

## Switch Statement

**Syntax :**

```cpp
switch(expression) {
   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; //optional
   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; //optional
  
   // you can have any number of case statements.
   default : //Optional
      statement(s);
}
```

```cpp
include <iostream>

void printDigitName(int x)
{
    switch (x)
    {
        case 1:
            std::cout << "One";
            return;
        case 2:
            std::cout << "Two";
            return;
        case 3:
            std::cout << "Three";
            return;
        default:
            std::cout << "Unknown";
            return;
    }
}

int main()
{
    printDigitName(2);
    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main () {
   // local variable declaration:
   char grade = 'D';

   switch(grade) {
      case 'A' :
         cout << "Excellent!" << endl; 
         break;
      case 'B' :
      case 'C' :
         cout << "Well done" << endl;
         break;
      case 'D' :
         cout << "You passed" << endl;
         break;
      case 'F' :
         cout << "Better try again" << endl;
         break;
      default :
         cout << "Invalid grade" << endl;
   }
   cout << "Your grade is " << grade << endl;
 
   return 0;
}
```

### Fall through

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    switch (2)
    {
    case 1: // Does not match
        std::cout << 1 << '\n'; // Skipped
    case 2: // Match!
        std::cout << 2 << '\n'; // Execution begins here
    case 3:
        std::cout << 3 << '\n'; // This is also executed
    case 4:
        std::cout << 4 << '\n'; // This is also executed
    default:
        std::cout << 5 << '\n'; // This is also executed
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# 7.1C - goto Statement

**Syntax :**

```
goto label;
... .. ...
... .. ...
... .. ...
label: 
statement;
... .. ...
```

```
Syntax1      |   Syntax2
----------------------------
goto label;  |    label:  
.            |    .
.            |    .
.            |    .
label:       |    goto label;
```
**Example :**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // for sqrt() function

int main()
{
    double x{};
tryAgain: // this is a statement label
    std::cout << "Enter a non-negative number: ";
    std::cin >> x;

    if (x < 0.0)
        goto tryAgain; // this is the goto statement

    std::cout << "The square root of " << x << " is " << std::sqrt(x) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

**Disadvantages of using goto statement:**

-   The use of goto statement is highly discouraged as it makes the program logic very complex.
-   use of goto makes the task of analyzing and verifying the correctness of programs (particularly those involving loops) very difficult.
-   Use of goto can be simply avoided using [break](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/break-statement-cc/) and [continue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/continue-statement-cpp/) statements.
