# 7.2A - While statements

Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

**SYNTAX :**
```cpp
while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}
```

**EXAMPLE  :**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int count{ 1 };
    while (count <= 10)
    {
        std::cout << count << ' ';
        ++count;
    }

    std::cout << "done!\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**Intentional infinite loops**


```cpp
while (true)
{
  // this loop will execute forever
}
```

## Loop variables should be signed

Loop variables should almost always be signed, as unsigned integers can lead to unexpected issues. Consider the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    unsigned int count{ 10 };

    // count from 10 down to 0
    while (count >= 0)
    {
        if (count == 0)
        {
            std::cout << "blastoff!";
        }
        else
        {
            std::cout << count << ' ';
        }
        --count;
    }

    std::cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

```ad-danger
It turns out, this program is an infinite loop. It starts out by printing `10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 blastoff!` as desired, but then goes off the rails, and starts counting down from `4294967295`. Why? Because the loop condition `count >= 0` will never be false! When count is `0`, `0 >= 0` is true. Then `--count` is executed, and count wraps around back to `4294967295` (Assuming 32-bit integers). And since `4294967295 >= 0` is true, the program continues. Because `count` is unsigned, it can never be negative, and because it can never be negative, the loop won’t terminate.
```

```ad-tip
Loop variables should be of type (signed) int.

```

## Nested loop
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // outer loops between 1 and 5
    int outer{ 1 };
    while (outer <= 5)
    {
        // For each iteration of the outer loop, the code in the body of the loop executes once

        // inner loops between 1 and outer
        int inner{ 1 };
        while (inner <= outer)
        {
            std::cout << inner << ' ';
            ++inner;
        }

        // print a newline at the end of each row
        std::cout << '\n';
        ++outer;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

# 7.2B - Do  While Statement
Privacy by design (PbD) is an approach for design & development of a digital solution that requires privacy to be embedded right from the design stage and then throughout the development lifecycle, so that privacy becomes integral part of core functionality as opposed to an afterthought.

Conceptualized in 2009, by the then Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, the PbD that constitutes 7 foundation principles were subsequently adopted by several data privacy regulators across the world. Since it is an approach and doesn’t elaborate on all the core privacy principles to be incorporated into design, in the rest of the module we will present an integrated view of approach combined with core privacy principles common to most global data protection regulations.

7 Principles of PbD:

1.   Proactive not Reactive; Preventive not Remedial
2.   Privacy as the Default setting
3.   Privacy embedded into design
4.   Full functionality; positive-sum, not zero sum 
5.   End-to-End Security
6.   Visibility and Transparency
7.   Respect for user privacy

## **Understanding of Context**

While embedding Privacy into design, the 1st step is to develop an understanding of context, which will greatly influence the choices to be made on design considerations. Context would include:

-   Environmental factors such as industry sector, type of data subjects, whether used for public or private use
-   Technological considerations.  Example: web-based, IoT, use of AI, accessibility on smartphones
-   Regulatory aspects- depending on the regions where it is proposed to be deployed, applicable regulatory requirements must be known
-   Customer expectations, and where customer is not known, any market expectations thru surveys, reports. 
-   Privacy objectives – whether organization wants to use privacy as a differentiator or take it as a compliance requirement.

Not all the above aspects will necessarily be clear while designing a solution, but a reasonable understanding of these is a prerequisite to be able to make design choices.  In agile development environment, where requirements on privacy may evolve based on newer functionality getting added downstream, certain essential aspects that have significant impact on the solution deployment if not finalized upfront, will have to be also taken into consideration upfront. One such example of such aspects is data localization, based on server or cloud provider constraints.

## **Applicability of Privacy Principles**

The processing of PII is guided by core data privacy principles which act like pillars of privacy. The applicability and scope of these principles varies in different legislations, and a knowledge on which ones will apply is essential. The principles detailed below are most commonly applicable ones.

###  Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency

There must be pre-identified grounds for processing of personal data for a specific purpose. These grounds may vary in different privacy regulations, but typically one of the below must be applied before commencing collection:

-    To fulfil a contractual requirement
-    Required by an applicable regulation (not data privacy)
-   Consent of data subject
-   Legitimate Business interest
-   To protect vital interests of data subject (permitted in exceptional circumstances)
-   Public interest (mostly meant for public bodies)

Collecting data without pre-determined legal basis and choosing more than one basis for same data processing activity and same data is unlawful.

Fairness means that processing must be done in ways that people would reasonably expect and not in ways that have unjustified adverse effects on them. Assessing whether processing is fair depends in part on how the data was obtained and how the processing affects individuals and whether an individual was able to take informed decision on sharing data. If an individual feel deceived or misled when the personal data was obtained, then this is unlikely to be fair. If a travel agency increases room rental based on customers’ perceived desperation determined from repeated search, using cookies, it will be called unfair.

According to the principle of transparency, the data subject should be provided with information about the processing, at the right time, in a comprehensible form, which is typically in the form of a privacy notice. The expectation is, no processing should happen on personal data that is not known to the individual. Depending on whether data were collected directly from him/her or from other sources, the transparency requirements by regulations may be different. 

### Purpose Limitation

According to principle of **purpose limitation**, personal data should be processed for "specified, explicit and legitimate purposes", i.e., the purpose of processing shall be specified before the processing starts and respected throughout the whole personal data lifecycle.

It helps individuals understand how their data is intended to be used for what purposes, which in turn helps them take informed decisions whether they like to share their details. It is fundamental to building public trust.

**Example of Violation of the principle of purpose limitation**: A school collects personal information of a student for its internal use such as conducting exams and declaring results.

 But the school ties up with a 3rd party - an online tutorials provider and sells student data without informing/taking consent of the guardian.

The 3rd party uses this data to send promotional messages.

### Data Minimization

Data minimization is one of the key principles, particularly difficult to implement, requiring personal data to be "adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed". This means that data that are not necessary to achieve the intended purpose cannot be lawfully collected, stored or otherwise processed.

To assess whether you are holding the right amount of personal data, you must first be clear about why you need it.

Example: An e-commerce website collects personal data such as name, address, mobile phone number for profile creation and processing of order.

![](https://lex.infosysapps.com/content-store/Infosys/Infosys_Ltd/Public/lex_auth_01318264673855897652/web-hosted/assets/ecom21609211853449.jpg)

It also collects wedding anniversary date and makes it mandatorily during profile creation.

The wedding anniversary date has no direct impact on the order processing and hence collection must be optional.

###  **Accuracy**

According to principle of Accuracy, Personal data shall be accurate kept up to date and every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.

Whether personal data always must be up to date depends on the purpose for which the information was used for. If the information is used for a purpose that relies on it remaining current, it should be kept up to date.

Example: A hospital records medical history and past treatments of the patient and use it as a reference in future treatments.The medical history and treatment record of the patient must be kept up-to-date and accurate.

Use of non-updated medical records of a patient whereby treatment records of his recently discovered allergies are missing can have serious health implications.

### Storage Limitation

Personal data must be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. Since regulations and business will require data to be retained for specified period, it is expected that it should be possible to deleted data beyond retention period. Ensuring that personal data is erased or anonymized when it is no longer needed will reduce the risk that it becomes irrelevant, excessive, inaccurate or out of date. It would also reduce unnecessary costs associated with storage and security.

Design of databases must take into account ease of deletion of data when no longer required.

###  Security

Ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability of personal data is one of the key principles of privacy.  Appropriate security measures – technical & organizational - are expected to be deployed taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

Poor information security posture leaves systems and services at risk and may cause real harm and distress to individuals. 

**Example**: An e-commerce website uses a payment gateway where payment details including credit card number are transmitted through non-encrypted channels. This may be exploited by fraudsters to misappropriate the identity of the user to make fake transactions.

### Accountabilty

The accountability principle requires an organization to take responsibility for the personal data it collects and processes, even though some of it may be processed by a 3rd party. There are two key elements under principle of Accountability:

1.  First, the accountability principle makes it clear that an organization, typically data controller, is **responsible** for ensuring compliance with the privacy laws.
2.  Second, There must be appropriate measures and records in place to be able to demonstrate your compliance.

In the context of privacy by design for a solution or product, where possible provision must be created to store logs and digital trails, which will help demonstrate compliance.
