# 1.3A - Keywords and naming identifiers

[**Token**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-tokens/)**:** When the compiler is processing the source code of a C++ program, each group of characters separated by white space is called a token. Tokens are the smallest individual units in a program. A C++ program is written using tokens. It has the following tokens:

## Keywords

Keywords are pre-defined or reserved words in a programming language.

**C** language supports **32** keywords which are given below:

```
auto         double      int        struct
break        else        long       switch
case         enum        register   typedef
char         extern      return     union
const        float       short      unsigned
continue     for         signed     void
default      goto        sizeof     volatile
do           if          static     while
```

While in **C++** there are **31** additional keywords other than **C** Keywords they are: 

```
asm          bool        catch          class
const_cast   delete      dynamic_cast   explicit
export       false       friend         inline
mutable      namespace   new            operator
private      protected   public         reinterpret_cast
static_cast  template    this           throw
true         try         typeid         typename
using        virtual     wchar_t
```
C++ also defines special identifiers: _override_, _final_, _import_, and _module_. These have a specific meaning when used in certain contexts but are not reserved.

## Identifiers

Identifiers are used as the general terminology for the naming of variables, functions and arrays

-   They must begin with a letter or underscore(_).
-   They must consist of only letters, digits, or underscore. No other special character is allowed.
-   It should not be a keyword.
-   It must not contain white space.
-   It should be up to 31 characters long as only the first 31 characters are significant.
-   **main:** method name.
-   **a:** variable name.

## Constants

Constants are also like normal variables. But, the only difference is, their values can not be modified by the program once they are defined. Constants refer to fixed values. They are also called literals.

**Syntax:**  
```cpp
const data_type variable_name;
const data_type *variable_name;
```

**Types of Constants:**   
 

1.  Integer constants – Example: 0, 1, 1218, 12482
2.  Real or Floating-point constants – Example: 0.0, 1203.03, 30486.184
3.  Octal & Hexadecimal constants – Example: octal: (013 )8 = (11)10, Hexadecimal: (013)16 = (19)10
4.  Character constants -Example: ‘a’, ‘A’, ‘z’
5.  String constants -Example: “GeeksforGeeks”

## Strings 

Strings are nothing but an array of characters ended with a null character `(‘\0’)`. This null character indicates the end of the string. Strings are always enclosed in double-quotes

**Declarations for String:**   

-   char string[20] = {‘g’, ’e’, ‘e’, ‘k’, ‘s’, ‘f’, ‘o’, ‘r’, ‘g’, ’e’, ‘e’, ‘k’, ‘s’, ‘\0’};
-   char string[20] = “geeksforgeeks”;
-   char string [] = “geeksforgeeks”;
-   when we declare char as “string[20]”, 20 bytes of memory space is allocated for holding the string value.
-   When we declare char as “string[]”, memory space will be allocated as per the requirement during the execution of the program.

## Special Symbols

The following special symbols are used in C having some special meaning and thus, cannot be used for some other purpose.[] () {}, ; * = #   
 
-   **Brackets`[]`:** Opening and closing brackets are used as array element reference. These indicate single and multidimensional subscripts.
-   **Parentheses():** These special symbols are used to indicate function calls and function parameters.
-   **Braces{}:** These opening and ending curly braces mark the start and end of a block of code containing more than one executable statement.
-   **Comma (, ):** It is used to separate more than one statements like for separating parameters in function calls.
-   **Colon(:):** It is an operator that essentially invokes something called an initialization list.
-   **Semicolon(;):** It is known as a statement terminator.  It indicates the end of one logical entity. That’s why each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon.
-   **Asterisk `(*)`:** It is used to create a pointer variable and  for the multiplication of variables.
-   **Assignment operator(=):** It is used to assign values and for the logical operation validation.
-   **Pre-processor (#):** The preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically by the compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.

## Operators

Operators are symbols that trigger an action when applied to C variables and other objects. The data items on which operators act upon are called operands.   

-   **Unary Operators:** Those operators that require only a single operand to act upon are known as unary operators. e.g. `i++`
-   **Binary Operators:** Those operators that require two operands to act upon are called binary operators. **Binary operators are classified into :** 
    1.  Arithmetic operators
    2.  Relational Operators
    3.  Logical Operators
    4.  Assignment Operators
    5.  Bitwise Operator
-   **Ternary Operator**: The operator that require three operands to act upon are called ternary operator. Conditional Operator(?) is also called ternary operator.   
    **Syntax**: `(Expression1)? expression2: expression3;`

# 1.3B - Whitespace and basic formatting

Whitespace is a term that refers to characters that are used for formatting purposes. In C++, this refers primarily to spaces, tabs, and newlines. The C++ compiler generally ignores whitespace, with a few minor exceptions (when processing text literals).

Consequently, the following statements all do the exact same thing:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello world!";

std::cout               <<            "Hello world!";

		std::cout << 		"Hello world!";

std::cout
	<< "Hello world!";

```

```cpp
int add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }

int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y; }

int add(int x, int y)
{    return x + y; }

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
```

**Auto Formatting** In Visual Studio Code, use Shift + Alt + F for autoformatting
