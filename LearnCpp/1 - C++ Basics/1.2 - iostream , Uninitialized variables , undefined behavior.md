The input/output library

The input/output library (io library) is part of the C++ standard library that deals with basic input and output. We’ll use the functionality in this library to get input from the keyboard and output data to the console. The _io_ part of _iostream_ stands for _input/output_.

## std::cout

std::cout, which allows us to send data to the console to be printed as text. _cout_ stands for “character output”.
In this program, we have included _iostream_ so that we have access to _std::cout_. Inside our _main_ function, we use _std::cout_, along with the insertion operator (`<<`), to send the text _Hello world!_ to the console to be printed

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!"; // print Hello world! to console

    return 0;
}
```


## std::endl
_std::endl_ prints a newline character to the console (causing the cursor to go to the start of the next line). In this context, _endl_ stands for “end line”.


## std::endl vs `\n`

Using std::endl can be a bit inefficient, as it actually does two jobs: it moves the cursor to the next line of the console, and it makes sure that any cached output shows up on the screen immediately (this is called flushing the output). When writing text to the console using std::cout, std::cout often flushes output anyway (and if it doesn’t, it usually doesn’t matter), so having std::endl perform a flush is rarely important.

Because of this, use of the ‘\n’ character is typically preferred instead. The ‘\n’ character moves the cursor to the next line of the console, but doesn’t request a flush, so it will perform better in cases where a flush would not otherwise happen. 

*Prefer `\n` over std::endl when outputting text to the console.*

```cpp
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 };
    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n'; // Using '\n' standalone
    std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n"; // Using '\n' embedded into a double-quoted piece of text (note: no single quotes when used this way)
    return 0;
}
```

## std::cin

`std::cin` is another predefined variable that is defined in the `iostream` library. Whereas `std::cout` prints data to the console using the insertion operator (`<<`), `std::cin` (which stands for “character input”) reads input from keyboard using the extraction operator (`>>`). The input must be stored in a variable to be used.

```cpp
#include <iostream>  // for std::cout and std::cin

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number: "; // ask user for a number

    int a{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    std::cin >> a; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x
    
	int x{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    int y{ }; // define variable y to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
    std::cin >> x >> y; // get two numbers and store in variable x and y respectively
    
    std::cout << "You entered " << a << '\n';
    std::cout << "You entered " << x << " and " << y << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

## Uninitialized variables

-   Initialization = The object is given a known value at the point of definition.
-   Assignment = The object is given a known value beyond the point of definition.
-   Uninitialized = The object has not been given a known value yet.

==What is an uninitialized variable? Why should you avoid using them?
An uninitialized variable is a variable that has not been given a value by the program (generally through initialization or assignment). Using the value stored in an uninitialized variable will result in undefined behavior.==

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // define an integer variable named x
    int x; // this variable is uninitialized because we haven't given it a value

    // print the value of x to the screen
    std::cout << x; // who knows what we'll get, because x is uninitialized

    return 0;
}
```

## Undefined behavior

==What is undefined behavior, and what can happen if you do something that exhibits undefined behavior? 
Undefined behavior is the result of executing code whose behavior is not well defined by the language. The result can be almost anything, including something that behaves correctly.==

Code implementing undefined behavior may exhibit _any_ of the following symptoms:

-   Your program produces different results every time it is run.
-   Your program consistently produces the same incorrect result.
-   Your program behaves inconsistently (sometimes produces the correct result, sometimes not).
-   Your program seems like its working but produces incorrect results later in the program.
-   Your program crashes, either immediately or later.
-   Your program works on some compilers but not others.
-   Your program works until you change some other seemingly unrelated code.


*Best Practice --> Take care to avoid all situations that result in undefined behavior, such as using uninitialized variable*
