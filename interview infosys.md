### What is Incremental and Iterative Development?

**Iterative Development:** It is basically a software development process where software development cycles (sprint and releases) are repeated until the final product is obtained. On the basis of feedback from customers or users, the product is again developed in cycles or releases and sprints i.e., adding new functionality in a repetitive manner.   
**Incremental Development:** It is basically a software development process where development works are sliced into increments or pieces or portions. In this, the software is developed and delivered in pieces or increments and each piece has a complete set of functionalities. The increment can either be small or large, and each increment is coded and tested fully. After testing each increment, they all are integrated so that they work as a whole

Re-factoring is basically an activity that involves alteration or modification of the internal structure of software without any change in its external behaviors or functionality.

### Explain Agile Testing? What are the principles of Agile Testing?

Agile testing, as the name suggests, is a software testing process where software is tested for any defects, errors, or other issues. It is considered a core part of the development process as it enables testers and developers to work together as a team that in turn improves overall performance. It also helps in ensuring the successful delivery of high-quality products. Testing is usually performed so that testers can identify and resolve the problems early and at every point in the development process.

**Principles of Agile Testing** 

There are eight main principles of Agile Testing as given below:

- **Continuous Testing:** Testing should be conducted continuously by the Agile team to ensure continuous development progress.  
- **Continuous Feedback:** This process generally encourages taking feedback from clients to make sure that the product meets the requirements of the client or customer.  
- **Team Work or collective work:** Not only testers but developers, business analysts can also perform software testing or application testing.  
- **Clean Code:** Quality of software is maintained as the team tests the software to ensure that the code is clean, simple, and tight. All errors and defects that are found during the testing phase are fixed quickly within the same iteration by the Agile Team. 
- **Less Documentation:** This process usually involves the usage of reusable checklists instead of lengthy documentation.  
- **Test-Driven:** In other conventional methods, testing is only performed after the implementation but in agile testing, testing is done during the implementation so that errors or any issues can be removed on time.  
- **Customer Satisfaction:** During the agile testing process, development progress is being shown to clients or customers so that they can adapt and update their requirements. This is done to ensure customer satisfaction.
  
### What are advantages and disadvantages of Agile Process.

**Advantages** 

There are several advantages of using the Agile Process as given below: 

- Adapt well with changing requirements 
- Face-to-face conversation with team members and customers 
- Focuses on technical excellence and good design 
- Fast and continuous development  
- Enables collaboration and interaction between client and project team 
- Ensure and promote customer satisfaction 
- Faster feedback from customers or end-users 
- Quick identification and elimination of errors found in the code  
- Division of agile project into sprints or iterations i.e., short and repeatable phases typically 1-4 weeks long 
- Quick delivery of products  
- Easy to manage with more flexibility  
- The end goal can be unknown: Agile is beneficial for projects where the goal is not defined and as the project progresses, the goal becomes more evident. 

**Disadvantages** 

There are several disadvantages of using Agile Process as given below: 

- Lack of formal documentation and designing 
- Difficult to estimate resource requirement and effort  
- Not good for small development projects 
- Costly as compared to other development methodologies 
- Requires more time and energy from everyone 
- Risk of ever-lasting project 
- Difficult to scale large projects 
- Difficulty in testing and test construction
