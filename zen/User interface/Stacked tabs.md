You can now switch any tab group in your workspace into a _tab stack_. Tab stacks provide an alternative way to view your tabs, reminiscent of Andy's Mode.

To convert a tab group into a tab stack, click the tab dropdown arrow at the end of the tab group. The first option in the list is a button to convert
tabs into a tab stack.

There is also a command available in the [[Command palette]] called "Toggle stacked tabs."
