```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []  # create an empty list to store the subsets
        subset = []  # create an empty list to store the current subset
        
        def dfs(i):  # define a recursive function called "dfs"
            if i >= len(nums):  # if we've processed all elements of the input list
                res.append(subset.copy())  # add the current subset to the list of subsets
                return
            
            subset.append(nums[i])  # add the i-th element of the input list to the current subset
            dfs(i+1)  # recursively call "dfs" with the i+1th element

            subset.pop()  # remove the i-th element of the input list from the current subset
            dfs(i+1)  # recursively call "dfs" without the i-th element
            
        dfs(0)  # start the recursive search at the first element of the input list
        return res  # return the list of subsets

```

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def rec(nums,i,subset,res):  # define a recursive helper function called "rec"
            if i == len(nums):  # if we've reached the end of the input list
                res.append(subset.copy())  # add the current subset to the list of subsets
            else:  # otherwise
                rec(nums,i+1,subset+[nums[i]],res)  # recursively call "rec" with the i+1th element added to the subset
                rec(nums,i+1,subset,res)  # recursively call "rec" without the i+1th element added to the subset
            return res  # return the list of subsets
        
        return rec(nums,0,[],[])  # call the recursive helper function with initial values for i, subset, and res

```

**Time Complexity:** O (N*(2^N))  
For every element there will be two cases, so O (2^N) and time taken to copy N elements.

**Space Complexity:** O(N)  
We have used extra space to store all elements for subsets.

## Bit Manipulation

To give all the possible subsets, we just need to exhaust all the possible combinations of the numbers. And each number has only two possibilities: either in or not in a subset. And this can be represented using a bit.

Using `[1, 2, 3]` as an example, `1` appears once in every two consecutive subsets, `2` appears twice in every four consecutive subsets, and `3` appears four times in every eight subsets (initially all subsets are empty):

```
[], [ ], [ ], [    ], [ ], [    ], [    ], [       ]
[], [1], [ ], [1   ], [ ], [1   ], [    ], [1      ]
[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [ ], [1   ], [2   ], [1, 2   ]
[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]
```

```python
def subsets(nums):
    n = len(nums)  # get the length of the input list
    res = []  # create an empty list to store the subsets
    
    # iterate through all possible combinations of the input list
    for i in range(2**n):  
	     # convert the current combination to binary and pad with leading zeros
        to_bin = bin(i)[2:].zfill(n) 
        subset = []  # create an empty list to store the current subset
        for j in range(n):  # iterate through the elements of the input list
            if to_bin[j] == '1':  # if the j-th digit of the binary representation is 1
                subset.append(nums[j])  # add the j-th element of the input list to the subset
        res.append(subset)  # add the current subset to the list of subsets
    return res  # return the list of subsets

```

## Iterative



Using `[1, 2, 3]` as an example, the iterative process is like:

1.  Initially, one empty subset `[[]]`
2.  Adding `1` to `[]`: `[[], [1]]`;
3.  Adding `2` to `[]` and `[1]`: `[[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]`;
4.  Adding `3` to `[]`, `[1]`, `[2]` and `[1, 2]`: `[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]`

```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # create an empty list res to store subsets
        res = [[]]
        # iterate through each element in nums
        for elem in nums:
            # iterate through each subset in res
            for i in range(len(res)):
                # append the current element to each subset in res and add it to res
                res.append(res[i]+[elem])
        # return the list of subsets
        return res
# [[]]
# ----------
# [[1]]
# ----------
# [[2]]
# [[1,2]]
# --------- Just need to add 3 to all subsets before this
# [[3]]
# [[1,3]]
# [[2,3]]
# [[1,2,3]]
# ---------- similarly add 4 to all subset before
