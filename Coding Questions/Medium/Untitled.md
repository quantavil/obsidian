According to ¹²⁵, the problem is to find all possible subsets of a given set of integers that may contain duplicates. One possible pseudocode for this problem is:

```
# Define a function that takes an array of integers and an index as parameters
function subsets(nums, index):
  # If index is equal to the length of nums, return an empty set
  if index == length(nums):
    return [[]]
  # Otherwise, recursively call subsets on the next index
  else:
    # Get the result of subsets(nums, index + 1)
    result = subsets(nums, index + 1)
    # Initialize an empty list to store the new subsets
    new_subsets = []
    # Loop through each subset in result
    for subset in result:
      # Append a new subset that contains nums[index] and the current subset
      new_subsets.append([nums[index]] + subset)
    # Sort the new subsets lexicographically
    new_subsets.sort()
    # Remove any duplicate subsets from the new subsets
    new_subsets = remove_duplicates(new_subsets)
    # Return the result concatenated with the new subsets
    return result + new_subsets

# Define a function that takes a sorted list of lists and removes any duplicates
function remove_duplicates(lists):
  # Initialize an empty list to store the unique lists
  unique_lists = []
  # Initialize a variable to store the previous list
  prev_list = None
  # Loop through each list in lists
  for list in lists:
    # If list is not equal to prev_list, append it to unique_lists and update prev_list
    if list != prev_list:
      unique_lists.append(list)
      prev_list = list
  # Return unique_lists
  return unique_lists

# Call subsets on the input array and index 0 after sorting it lexicographically
subsets(sort(nums), 0)
```
