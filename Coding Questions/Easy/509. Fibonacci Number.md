## Approach 1 : Memoization  Top-Down  DP

The top-down approach in dynamic programming involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, and solving the subproblems recursively while memoizing the results to avoid redundant calculations. 

```python
class Solution:
    cache = {}
    
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n in self.cache: # check if the result has already been cached
            return self.cache[n]

        # calculate the result recursively
        if n <= 1:
            self.cache[n] = n
        else:
            self.cache[n] = self.fib(n-1) + self.fib(n-2)
        
        return self.cache[n]

```

## Approach 1 : Bottom-Up DP

This implementation uses a bottom-up approach, which means that we start with the smallest subproblems (the base cases) and work our way up to the solution for the full problem.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    # Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
	 fib_0 , fib_1 = 0,1 
    
    # Compute the Fibonacci numbers for i=2 to n
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        # Compute the i-th Fibonacci number as the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers
        fib_i = fib_0 + fib_1
        
        # Update the values of fib_0 and fib_1 for the next iteration
        fib_0 = fib_1
        fib_1 = fib_i
    
    # Return the n-th Fibonacci number
    return fib_i

```
