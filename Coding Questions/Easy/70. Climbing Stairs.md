## Approach 1 : Brute Force

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Base cases: there is only one way to climb 0 or 1 step.
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        
        # Recursive step: the number of ways to climb to the current step is equal to
        # the sum of the number of ways to climb to the previous two steps.
        return self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)

```

##  Approach 2 : Dynamic Programming

This code implements the "Fibonacci sequence" method for solving the "Climbing Stairs" problem. The idea is that the number of ways to climb to step `n` is equal to the sum of the number of ways to climb to step `n-1` and `n-2`. This is exactly the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Initialize variables a and b to represent the number of ways to climb to the
        # current step and the next step, respectively. We start at step 0 with 0 ways to climb.
        a, b = 0, 1
        
        # Use a loop to calculate the number of ways to climb to each step up to n.
        for _ in range(n):
            # Update variables a and b to represent the number of ways to climb to the
            # next step and the step after that, respectively.
            a, b = b, a + b
        
        # After the loop is done, the value of b represents the number of ways to climb to
        # the last step (step n). Return b as the result.
        return b
