## Approach 1 : HashMap
```python
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):  # check if the lengths are different
        return False
    freq = {}  # initialize the frequency table
    for c in s:  # count the frequency of each character in s
        freq[c] = freq.get(c, 0) + 1
    for c in t:  # decrement the frequency of each character in t
        if c not in freq or freq[c] <= 0:  # if the character is not in s or its frequency is already 0, then t is not an anagram of s
            return False
        freq[c] -= 1
    return True

```

**Time complexity :** O(n)
**Space complexity:** O(n)

## Approach 3 : 

```python

def anagram(s, t):
  """
  Decide if two strings are anagrams or not.

  Args:
    s: The first string.
    t: The second string.

  Returns:
    True if s and t are anagrams, False otherwise.
  """

  # Check if the two strings have the same length.
  # If they don't, then they cannot be anagrams.

  if len(s) != len(t):
    return False

  # Create a count array to store the number of occurrences of each character in s.

  count = [0] * 26

  # Iterate over the characters in s and increment the corresponding count in the count array.

  for c in s:
    count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1

  # Iterate over the characters in t and decrement the corresponding count in the count array.

  for c in t:
    count[ord(c) - ord('a')] -= 1

  # Check if all the counts in the count array are 0.
  # If they are, then the two strings are anagrams.

  for i in range(26):
    if count[i] != 0:
      return False

  # Return True if the two strings are anagrams, False otherwise.

  return True

```

**Time complexity :** O(n log n)
**Space complexity:** O(n)
