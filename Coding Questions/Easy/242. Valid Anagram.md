## Approach 1 : 
```python
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):  # check if the lengths are different
        return False
    freq = {}  # initialize the frequency table
    for c in s:  # count the frequency of each character in s
        freq[c] = freq.get(c, 0) + 1
    for c in t:  # decrement the frequency of each character in t
        if c not in freq or freq[c] == 0:  # if the character is not in s or its frequency is already 0, then t is not an anagram of s
            return False
        freq[c] -= 1
    return True

```

## Approach 2 : Sorting


```python
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):  # check if the lengths are different
        return False
    s_sorted = sorted(s)  # sort the characters of s
    t_sorted = sorted(t)  # sort the characters of t
    return s_sorted == t_sorted  # check if the sorted strings are the same

```

**Time complexity :** O(n log n)
