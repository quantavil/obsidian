**✔️ Solution 1: Using  left and right pointer**
let use initialize Left and Right pointer to first and second position of array
Here Left is to buy stock and Right is to sell stock

    Then we initialize our max_profit as 0

    Now we will start our while loop and we will run till our Right pointer less then length of array
    For Example:

    prices=[7,1,5,3,6,4]
   Note:
        prices[left] --> buy stock
        prices[right] --> sell stock
    now we will check price at right and left pointer
    step 1:
    price[left]=7 price[right]=1 profit=-6
here price[left] is greater than price[right] so we will move left pointer to the right position and increment our right pointer by 1. We always want our left point to be minimum
    step 2:
    price[left]=1 price[right]=5 profit=4
    here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone
    step 3:
    price[left]=1 price[right]=3 profit=2
    here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will check our max_profit previously it was 4 now our current profit is 2 so we will check which is maximum and update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone
    step 4:
    price[left]=1 price[right]=6 profit=5
    here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will check our max_profit previously it was 4 now our current profit is 5 so we will check which is maximum and update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone
    step 5:
    price[left]=1 price[right]=4 profit=3
    same logic as above


```python
class Solution:
	def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int: 
	res = 0 
	l = 0
	for r in range(1,len(prices)):
		if prices[r] < prices[l]:
			l = r
		res = max(res,prices[r]-prices[l])
		return res
```
