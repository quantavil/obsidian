**C++ supports the following data types:**

1.  **Primary** or **Built-in** or **Fundamental data type**
2.  **Derived data types**
3.  **User-defined data types**

## Primary Data Types

These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables

-   **Integer**: Integers typically require 4 bytes of memory space and range from - 2^32 to 2^32 -1.  
-   **Character**: Character data type is used for storing characters.  Characters typically require 1 byte of memory space and range from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255.  
-   **Boolean**: Boolean data type is used for storing Boolean or logical values. A Boolean variable can store either _true_ or _false_. 
-   **Floating Point**: Floating Point data type is used for storing single-precision floating-point values or decimal values. Float variables typically require 4 bytes of memory space. 
-   **Double Floating Point**: Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double-precision floating-point values or decimal values. Double variables typically require 8 bytes of memory space.
-  **void**: Void means without any value. void data type represents a valueless entity. A void data type is used for those function which does not return a value.
- -   **sizeof() operator:** [sizeof() operator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sizeof-operator-c) is used to find the number of bytes occupied by a variable/data type in computer memory.
